## ✨ Highlights

- 📊 Built on a simulated banking customer dataset (~10,000 rows)  
- 🔍 Explored churn drivers using interactive Plotly visualizations  
- ⚙️ Engineered features including dummy variables, scaling, and preprocessing  
- 🤖 Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models  
- 📈 Evaluated model performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC  
- 🧪 Demonstrated live prediction on new customer data  
- 🔄 Reproducible and modular pipeline designed for easy scaling and deployment

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 1. 📁 Data Loading & Preparation

- Loaded and cleaned a simulated bank customer dataset with ~10,000 records  
- Ensured data integrity and handled missing values  

### 2. 🧭 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized key features and churn correlations using Plotly  
- Saved visualizations as PNGs for reporting and transparency  

### 3. 🧱 Feature Engineering

- Applied dummy encoding for categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features where appropriate  
- Created meaningful derived features to boost model performance  

### 4. 🤖 Modeling & Comparison

- Trained three models:  
  - Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)  
  - Random Forest (robust, nonlinear)  
  - XGBoost (state-of-the-art gradient boosting)   

### 5. 📈 Model Evaluation

- Evaluated using multiple metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC  

### 6. 🧪 Prediction Demonstration

- Showcased live predictions on new customer samples with interpretability explanations
