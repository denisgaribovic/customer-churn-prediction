# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End Data Science Project

This project tackles a common and financially significant problem in multiple sectors: **customer churn**.

The goal is to **identify which customers are at risk of leaving** using historical banking data and to build an interpretable and production-ready machine learning model to support **retention strategies**.

## 🔍 Business Context

Customer acquisition is expensive — retaining existing customers is critical for **sustainable growth**. With thousands of customers and multiple touchpoints, companies need **data-driven approaches** to predict and prevent churn.

This project simulates how a company might:
- Analyse customer data to understand churn drivers
- Build predictive models to anticipate churn risk
- Support business decisions with interpretable, actionable insights

## 🎯 Business Value

✅ Enables **early identification** of customers at risk  
✅ Supports **data-driven marketing** and **customer retention strategy**  
✅ Builds a **reproducible churn prediction pipeline** for future scaling  
✅ Showcases strong **data storytelling** and **real-world problem solving**

| Phase               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **📁 Data Loading** | Data prepared from a simulated bank customer dataset (~10,000 rows)         |
| **🧭 EDA**          | Exploratory Data Analysis with `Plotly` visualisations (saved as PNGs)      |
| **🧱 Feature Engineering** | Dummy encoding, scaling, and thoughtful preprocessing                       |
| **🤖 Modeling**     | Trained and compared 3 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  |
| **📈 Evaluation**   | Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC for fair comparison |
| **🧪 Prediction**   | Demonstrated a live prediction on sample customer data                      |
